# Hibiscus
Hibiscus is a content-less webpage that can serve as inspiration for other applications. It was developed with the purpose of learning the basics of creating webpages. The code provided in this repository does not entirely match what can be seen on the [Hibiscus website](https://hibiscus-gaming.web.app/), as at some point I lost a large portion of the files. However, they remain hosted on Firebase without me being able to recover them. Nevertheless, this led me to enhance the website's implementation by introducing basic PHP concepts to enable modular functionality.

# Design
- Nav:
From the navigation bar, you can access the different sections of the website. Additionally, there is a search bar in case you want to find specific articles using keywords. (I was using an already implemented search bar, but the idea is to implement my own search engine).

The previous was the view from a PC, but with a mobile phone there is implemented a responsive nav:
